# Overview
This repository contains my supplementary work for analyzing a banking dataset using Tableau. Most of the work is done in Tableau but my non-Tableau work will be pushed to this repository for separate version control.

# Tableau Page
Please see the following link for my work in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacob.paxton

# Dataset
This banking dataset was compiled from real-world financial data. You can find it here: https://data.world/lpetrocelli/retail-banking-demo-data

In addition, I created a file for a Tableau dashboard component, and the code for that file is in bank_analysis.ipynb.
